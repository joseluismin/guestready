  <section>
    <h2 class="emoji">üìä Revenue & Pricing Metrics</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Occupancy Rate</strong>: Percentage of days properties are booked. Indicates demand and pricing effectiveness.</li>
      <li><strong>Average Daily Rate (ADR)</strong>: Average income earned per rented night. Essential for pricing strategy.</li>
      <li><strong>RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room/Unit)</strong>: ADR √ó Occupancy rate or total revenue √∑ total available nights. Measures efficiency in pricing & occupancy.</li>
      <li><strong>Adjusted RevPAR (ARPAR)</strong>: Revenue minus variable costs per night √∑ total available nights. Shows net revenue impact.</li>
      <li><strong>Revenue Growth Rate</strong>: Measures the year-over-year increase in income. Indicates business expansion and success.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2 class="emoji">üí∞ Profitability & Investment Metrics</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Net Operating Income (NOI)</strong>: Rental income minus operating expenses (cleaning, maintenance, etc.). Crucial for evaluating business profitability.</li>
      <li><strong>Net Income / Margin</strong>: NOI minus taxes, administration, and financing costs √∑ total revenue. Shows overall profitability of the operation.</li>
      <li><strong>Revenue per Property</strong>: Total revenue generated √∑ number of units. Helps benchmark the contribution of individual properties to the overall portfolio.</li>
      <li><strong>Gross Rent Multiplier (GRM)</strong>: Property price √∑ Gross annual rental income. Used to determine if a property is a good investment based on its income potential.</li>
      <li><strong>Capital Expenditures (CapEx)</strong>: Funds spent by the company to acquire, upgrade, and maintain physical assets such as property, industrial buildings, or equipment. These are significant investments in major improvements.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2 class="emoji">‚öôÔ∏è Efficiency & Cost Metrics</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Operating Expense Ratio (OER)</strong>: Total operating expenses √∑ gross operating income. Measures how well costs are controlled (ideal range typically 60‚Äì80%).</li>
      <li><strong>Cost per Unit/Night</strong>: Average cost incurred for services like cleaning, utilities, and minor repairs on a per-unit or per-night basis. Helps manage hidden expenses and operational overhead.</li>
      <li><strong>Maintenance Cost per Unit</strong>: The average cost associated with maintaining each property unit. This helps in budgeting for repairs and assessing the efficiency of maintenance operations.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2 class="emoji">üìà Portfolio & Growth Metrics</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Unit Turnover / Vacancy Rate</strong>: Percentage of unused nights or unoccupied units. Indicates idle time within the portfolio and potential lost income.</li>
      <li><strong>Tenant Turnover Rate</strong>: The frequency with which tenants move out of properties. Particularly relevant for long-term rentals, indicating tenant satisfaction and lease management effectiveness.</li>
      <li><strong>Average Length of Stay (ALOS)</strong>: Total nights booked √∑ total number of bookings. Longer stays generally lead to lower turnover costs and higher efficiency.</li>
      <li><strong>Revenue per Channel</strong>: Breakdown of revenue generated from each booking platform (e.g., Airbnb, Booking.com, direct bookings). Guides marketing efforts and distribution strategy optimization.</li>
      <li><strong>Average Days to Rent</strong>: Measures the time it takes to fill a vacant unit from the moment it becomes available. A lower number indicates efficient marketing and tenant placement.</li>
      <li><strong>Renewal Rate</strong>: Percentage of tenants who renew their leases. A high renewal rate indicates tenant satisfaction and reduces turnover costs.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2 class="emoji">üîß Operational & Guest Experience Metrics</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Guest Satisfaction / Ratings</strong>: Scores or reviews from guests. Higher satisfaction generally leads to better Average Daily Rate (ADR) and repeat bookings.</li>
      <li><strong>Inquiry-to-Booking Rate</strong>: Percentage of inquiries that convert into confirmed bookings. Measures the effectiveness of the sales funnel and responsiveness.</li>
      <li><strong>Cancellation Rate</strong>: Percentage of bookings that are cancelled. A high rate can indicate issues with pricing, property description, or unexpected events, leading to lost revenue and planning difficulties.</li>
      <li><strong>Delinquency Rate</strong>: Measures the percentage of tenants who are late on their rent payments. Essential for assessing cash flow and the effectiveness of rent collection processes.</li>
    </ul>
